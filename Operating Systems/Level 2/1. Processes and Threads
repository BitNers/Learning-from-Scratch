The Operating System is responsible to schedule the processes in the computer, but... what is a process?

    To understand processes, we need to understand the program.
    What exactly is a program?

        #include <stdio.h>

        int main(void){
            printf("Hello World");
        }

    
    This an example in C how we print 'Hello World'.
    Look how we have commons words that made us able to understand this code.
    This is what we call the High Level Language, which we can write a set of instructions readable for humans.

    There is another HLL such as Python or Javascript, to print with Python we use ONLY one line.

        print("Hello World")


    Amazing don't ya? 
    Therefore, you have talked about that computers only read/write binaries numbers (0-1).
    How the computer understand what I wrote? There is something between the User Interface and the Hardware?
    There is, and his name is the Compiler and Interpreter.
    We won't get deep into these guys for now, let's get back to understand what is a process.


    Well, knowing what is a program, the process is just a program in execution.
    The program is a PASSIVE ENTITY, that means, the program is stored in Disk, instead in RAM.
        The program doesn't have the a process stack, or program counter or registers to execute.


    The Process is not as same as program, because it is an active entity that actions the purpose of the application.
    The computer loads the program from Disk and store at RAM, making an active entity, including the program counter, process stack and registers in CPU.
        The Process Stack is the Cached RAM to provide an additional space if required. 
        This memory is divided into four sections for efficient working:

            - Text sections -> Is made for compiled program code, where is Read-Only code stays when the program is launched.
            - Data sections -> Is made for global and static variables, allocated and initialized prior to executing the program.
            - Heap -> Is made for Dynamic Memory Allocation. 
            - Stack -> Is made for Local Variables. The space on the stack is reserved for local variables whey they are declared.

                * In Programming Languages, Local Variables is the variable declared inside a function. 
                    Variables declared outside the function, we can call Global Variables.
                    Static variables has your values preserved even after they are out of their scope.





    Now that we know what is a process, we need to understand their differente states.
    Remember the processes are active entities, that means they can be in any of the following states:

        - NEW -> The process is being created. The OS is allocating resources. 
        - READY -> The process is ready to run, waiting to be assigned by the processor.
        - RUNNING -> The Program's Instructions are being executed.
        - WAITING -> The process is waiting for some event to occur (I/O completion or reception of a signal)
        - TERMINATED -> The process has finished execution.

    But wait, we have rules to these states.
    The first obvious is that we can't have processes in READY RUNNING WAITING or TERMINATED states, if it the NEW state was never executed.

    This graph will help to understand this. The states are linked, and we must respect these rules.


                 ____________                  
               /              \            
    NEW -> READY             WAITING
                \  RUNNING  /
                            \
                             TERMINATED

 
    The process always going to start with NEW state, then the must next step is READY.
    After that, they gonna be in RUNNING STATE, which can be TERMINATED or WAITING.
    The WAITING will wait for some event, and then, will return to the READY STATE.



    As we talked before, the process is an active entity, which means they have a block control for attributes such as memory, and registers.
    Each process is a Data Structure which contains the following.

        - Process ID -> A.K.A PID, is the identification for Process in a System.
        - Process State -> It can be Running, or Ready, etc.
        - CPU Registers and Program Counter -> Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed for that process.
        - CPU Scheduling -> Priority information and pointers for scheduling queues (We gonna see this later)
        - Memory Management -> Pages/Segment Tables, Heap and Stack, etc.
        - Accounting Information -> User and Kernel CPU usage, limits, etc.
        - I/O Status information -> Devices allocated, open file tables, etc.
