As we seen before, the process is an active entity having attributes to manage it.
    Processes has states, that changes if needed.
    The act to change the process that is in the READY state to RUNNING state is known as Process Scheduling.

    The prime idea of Process Scheduling is to keep the CPU busy all the time, to deliver the minimum response time for all programs.
    For achieving this, the schedular must apply appropriate rules for swapping processes IN and OUT of CPU.

    Scheduling will fell into two general categories:
        
        - Pre-emptive -> When the currently executing process gives up the CPU voluntarily.
        - Non Pre-empetive -> When the OS decides to favour another process, pre-empting the currently executing process.



What are Scheduling Queues?

    All processes, upon entering into the system, are stored in the Job Queue.
    Processes in the READY state are placed in the READY Queue.
    Processes waiting for a device to become available are placed in Device Queues. There are unique device queues available for each I/O device.

    A new process is initially put in the READY queue. It waits in the READY queue until it is selected for execution(or dispatched). 
    Once the process is assigned to the CPU and is executing, one of the following several events can occur:

    The process could issue an I/O request, and then be placed in the I/O queue.
    The process could create a new subprocess and wait for its termination.
    The process could be removed forcibly from the CPU, as a result of an interrupt, and be put back in the READY queue.

    In the first two cases, the process eventually switches from the waiting state to the READY state, and is then put back in the READY queue. 
    A process continues this cycle until it terminates, at which time it is removed from all queues and has its PCB and resources deallocated.



Types of Schedulers
    There are three types of schedulers available:

        - Long Term Scheduler
        - Short Term Scheduler
        - Medium Term Scheduler
    
    Let's discuss about all the different types of Schedulers in detail:


    Long Term Scheduler
        Long term scheduler runs less frequently. 
        Long Term Schedulers decide which program must get into the job queue.
        From the job queue, the Job Processor, selects processes and loads them into the memory for execution. 
        Primary aim of the Job Scheduler is to maintain a good degree of Multiprogramming. 
        An optimal degree of Multiprogramming means the average rate of process creation is equal to the average departure rate of processes from the execution memory.


    Short Term Scheduler
        This is also known as CPU Scheduler and runs very frequently. 
        The primary aim of this scheduler is to enhance CPU performance and increase process execution rate.


    Medium Term Scheduler
        This scheduler removes the processes from memory (and from active contention for the CPU), and thus reduces the degree of multiprogramming. 
        At some later time, the process can be reintroduced into memory and its execution van be continued where it left off. This scheme is called swapping. 
        The process is swapped out, and is later swapped in, by the medium term scheduler.

    
    Swapping may be necessary to improve the process mix, or because a change in memory requirements has 
    asovercommitted available memory, requiring memory to be freed up.
